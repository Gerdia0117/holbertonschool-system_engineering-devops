This infrastructure is designed to scale up by separating components and adding
redundancy. Two HAProxy load balancers are configured as a cluster to eliminate
the load balancer single point of failure and ensure high availability.

The web servers are separated and run only Nginx to handle HTTP requests. The
application server is isolated to process business logic, improving performance
and scalability. The database is hosted on its own server to store persistent
data and avoid resource contention.

Separating components allows each layer to scale independently, improves system
reliability, and simplifies maintenance.
