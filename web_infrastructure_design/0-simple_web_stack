This web infrastructure consists of a single server hosting a simple web stack.
The domain name foobar.com has a www A record that points to the server IP
address 8.8.8.8.

When a user accesses www.foobar.com, the DNS resolves the domain name to the
server IP address. The user’s browser sends an HTTP or HTTPS request to the
server. Nginx acts as the web server and receives the request, then forwards it
to the application server. The application server executes the application
logic and communicates with the MySQL database to retrieve or store data. The
response is then sent back to the user through Nginx.

Main issues with this infrastructure:
- It has a single point of failure (SPOF) because everything is hosted on one
  server.
- Maintenance or deployment requires restarting services, which causes
  downtime.
- It cannot scale to handle high traffic since there is only one server.
