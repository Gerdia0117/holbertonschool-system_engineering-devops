This infrastructure is secured and monitored to host www.foobar.com. Traffic is
served over HTTPS using an SSL certificate terminated at the load balancer. Three
firewalls are used to protect the infrastructure and control network traffic.

The load balancer distributes traffic across two backend servers in an
Active-Active configuration. Each server runs a web server (Nginx), an
application server, application files, and a MySQL database. Monitoring agents
are installed on each server to collect logs and metrics and send them to a
monitoring service.

Monitoring is used to track server health, detect failures, and measure
performance metrics such as QPS. Monitoring agents collect data directly from
the servers and forward it to a centralized system.

Issues with this infrastructure include:
- SSL termination at the load balancer exposes unencrypted internal traffic
- Only one MySQL server can accept write operations, creating a SPOF
- Hosting all components on the same servers can cause resource contention
